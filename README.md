### Site Surveys

Field Advantage provides site surveys for many of our clients. In certain instances, a site survey may be needed for documentation purposes only. However, it is our experience that most site surveys act as the prerequisite for infrastructure upgrades. Site surveys are critical for identifying potential issues early so that the installation can be executed quickly and efficiently. Our technicians are trained to photograph and document key findings as well as identify any possible problems that may need to be resolved before installation takes place.  We understand that accurate site surveys are critical to the success for national deployments, and are instrumental in allowing our clients the ability to identify any issues that may arise before the day of installation.

### Deployments

Also known as rollouts, Field Advantage understands that deployments can be as simple as a few locations or as complex as thousands of sites nationwide. Regardless of the scope, we are committed to ensuring our clients receive the best possible service and support. We assign a senior project manager for each deployment project, and our senior project managers ensure that each technician has the correct credentials and experience to guarantee quality and help eliminate errors. At Field Advantage, we never leave a job unfinished and our comprehensive methods for deployment scheduling and implementation have made us a leader in the industry.

### Digital Menu Boards and Signage

Technology has come a long way. Gone are the days of climbing up ladders and posting menu items with large plastic letters.  This process can now be completely automated due to the emergence and affordability of large high resolution monitors.  A digital menu makes it easy to switch out items, change prices, or cater to different times of the day. Field Advantage technicians will prepare the worksite, install the equipment, and calibrate the monitors.

### Network Installations

With the Internet of Things (IOT) revolutionizing the way we do business, properly functioning network equipment is fundamental to keeping those digital signals operational.  Our Field Advantage technicians are trained to install new or replacement network gear, as well as create new cable runs and configure connected equipment.  Our technicians also document and label existing networks to help ensure improved remote network support.

## About Us

Field Advantage started its roots in Duluth, MN in the summer of 2007.  The company began as an IT service provider catered to clients needing evening and weekend service.  In the spring of 2009, Field Advantage’s CEO, John-Paul Damico, expanded the company to 9 locations across MN and WI. In the Fall of 2010, Damico took what he learned from the regional expansion and started the national expansion.  By 2011, Field Advantage had expanded to over 100 locations nationwide.

In 2013 the company headquarters was moved from Northern Minnesota to Norfolk, Virginia. It was at this time that the company began focusing heavily on commercial services as its footprint, over 250 markets now, was able to provide turn-key solutions to enterprise clients.

“There have been a lot of ups and downs rolling our services out all over the country. When a company is expanding as rapidly as we are, there is bound to be growing pains. We evaluate and streamline our processes and workflow on a daily basis.” Damico said.

In 2017 the company rebranded itself as Field Advantage as it had shifted its focus from after hours support to an enterprise field solutions provider.  Field Advantage is a 24 hour on-site technology service that specializes in the retail and entertainment industry.  Technicians are now all over the country (all 50 states) servicing commercial and enterprise clients.

Damico said, “We are unique because our technicians have flexible schedules and our overhead is extremely low. This means we can be less expensive than our competitors and service our clients on their time frame.”

When asked why Damico named it Field Advantage, he replied “Because at the national level, it is extremely difficult to have the support and expertise where home-base might be.  With highly skilled technicians and unparalleled client services, we provide the client with that home field advantage that they are looking for.”
